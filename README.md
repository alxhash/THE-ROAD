# THE-ROAD
Documentation of my computer science journey from Scratch :)

So just to be short, I want document my journey of programming and learning about computer science in order to connect and share my knowledge with all ou yall :)
I figure, by involving the internet in my journey, I may have the opportunity to meet cool people and find more guidance for specific topics.

To tell you some...

I'll countinue when I'm back from the gym xD

Sooooo I'm back :) I started doing some coding tutorials today and try to get some work done for today. Before going into my studies in september, I'll try to manage so solid porjects or at least some useful knowledge in some of the main programming languages for my data science degree (Pyhton, C, SQL etc.) 
I'll keep u updated on my progress.
Probably in 1-2 weeks, I can start pulling some repos for my first project. I don't really know what to tackle first but u guys can share some solid ideas if you got good ones.
I think, I have marked a repo with some good beginner projects. Probably starting with that then :)
